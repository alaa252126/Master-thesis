# Master-thesis
Repository for my master's thesis in Simulation and Visualization focused on optimizing deep learning techniques for real-time detection and tracking of marine species using YOLOv8 and Deep SORT algorithms. This repository contains the relevant files used in the study. Please refer to the README file for further details

# Prerequisites
[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/)

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)


# Preparing the environment
To set up the environment with all the necessary libraries, please refer to [ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for instructions 

# Downloading the dataset
The data was collected by recording videos using the Blueye Pioneer underwater drone. These videos were extracted into 150,000 images, and only  17,000 images were annotated due to the time-consuming nature of the process. the dataset was supplied by Bj√∏rn Christian Weinbach at Vestlandsforsking, as he wants to explore and optimize algorithms for object detection and segmentation as a part of his doctoral research.
